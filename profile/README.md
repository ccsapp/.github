# CCSApp

CCSApp is a university software project that aims to provide an example for the CMEng engineering model and demonstrate a well-tested software project. It offers two main capabilities: fleet management for administrators and rental booking for customers. These can be found [here](https://github.com/ccsapp/docs/blob/main/pages/capabilities.md).

The app is build with Go and the Echo framework. The frontend is built with Angular. We use Docker to build and deploy the app. 

We hope that this project can be used as a reference for other projects and that it can be used to learn about software engineering, especially testing.
